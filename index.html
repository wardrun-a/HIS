        <h2>Once upon a time there lived a boy very happily. By the time he grew up
        he find out this world is full of evil and what he saw all his life was fake.
        with a lot of his bad experience, failure and fear of that he will become one of them he decided to
      live a life that no one will be wanting him for evil responsiblity. he wasn't that good enough though
       his way of life lead him to a pit where mocking and ignorance was the gift of existing. he was fed up
        with pleasing and living for everyone he decided to connect with the oneness by the end of that journey he realised
      the source of all this evil presence in this world is from the place where he was walking towards. he was really disappointed with that
    journey he chose as his last so he just tried to unattach with this worldly and humanly desires and greed to make him feel himself that he is not part
  of this evil deeds. On his walk he learned empathy where he felt for all the creatures living here the role they have taken for the timepass
of the powerful entity in this universe. his heart filled with hatred to the one who is responsible
for this, also his vast amount of love didn't allowed him hate it at all. In this way he was living for a while. one day in his boring times he got connected with a random beautiful soul
who he felt that the one who deserve this vast amount of love he posses. He fell in love with her Deeply, Madly and truly. he don't know how this happened also he wonders is a human capable of loving this way?
it was a kind of feeling that he is just loving this person for her existence. who is his own part of existence. She just worked with her unknown magical gift which made him reconnect to this world. and he is sure that he can achieve a lot
for the one that he thinks that the purpose of his life to make her happy and not to let her eyes spit a single drop of tear.<br /><br /><br />
 And i wish all the best and blessings for him to achieve what he thinks that is HIS.</h2>
